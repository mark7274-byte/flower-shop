        <h1>Floral Bouquets FAQs</h1>
<b>Can I order a bouquet of flowers in any color?</b>
<br>
Yes, you can order a bouquet of flowers from Proflowers in any color.
 Because we know certain colors have special meanings to different people, we have bouquets arranged by flower type but also by color.
  You can browse our yellow bouquets, white bouquets, and even blue bouquets to be able to pick the flower bouquet perfect for your special occasion.

 You read that right, the large selection of flower bouquets we have available on our website are all available to be ordered and delivered right to your door.

<br>
<b>Can I select how large I want my flower bouquet to be?</b>
<br>
A great way to be able to tell how large the flower bouquet you are purchasing is by the price. You can choose a more expensive bouquet if you want a huge flower bouquet, or you can go for a smaller handheld bouquet in a lower price range. Because you can filter by price, you are also able to select how large you want your flower bouquet to be.
<br>
<b>How can I make a bouquet of flowers last longer?</b>
<br>
Changing water frequently, keeping them out of direct sunlight, ensuring they are in a cool environment, and snipping the ends when changing the water are all steps you can take to make your bouquet last as long as possible.
<br>
<b>What’s in a bouquet of flowers?</b>
